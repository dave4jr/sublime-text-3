		<h4>Awbrey Butte</h4>
		<hr class="zigzag medium">
		<p class="m-t-15 text-justify">Awbrey Butte is in NW Bend and locals refer to it simply as “The Butte.” Some of the nicest and largest homes in Bend are located on The Butte and some of Bend’s most amazing Cascade Mountain views can be found here, particularly on the NW side of The Butte. Some homes enjoy views of the entire mountain range from Mt. Bachelor to Mt. Hood. The southern and southeastern sides of The Butte have views of Downtown Bend and Pilot Butte, where the fireworks display takes place each 4th of July. Awbrey Butte has 786 homesites with a mix of older and new homes, and the lots are generally larger (0.25 – 0.5 acre on average) and heavily treed, which provides privacy and a sense of being surrounded by open space. Fences are discouraged on The Butte, which contributes to the open feel and allows wildlife to migrate through the area. The Butte is also home to two golf clubs, The Awbrey Glen Golf Club and River’s Edge Golf Resort, tennis courts, and numerous parks and trails. Awbrey Butte does have a Home Owner’s Association with a small annual fee that enforces the CC&Rs that protect the owner’s property values and beautiful neighborhood appearance.  Popular subdivisions on The Butte include: Awbrey Butte, Awbrey Glen, Awbrey Meadows, Awbrey Park, Awbrey Point, Awbrey Village, Awbrey Woods, North Rim, River’s Edge Village, River Park Estates, Wyndemere, City View, and The Heights of Bend. Home values range from around $400,000 to well over $1,000,000.</p>

		<h4>River West</h4>
		<hr class="zigzag medium">
		<p class="m-t-15 text-justify">As the name implies, the River West neighborhood in Bend, OR is located on the west side of the Deschutes River. Many people consider this neighborhood to be a continuation of downtown and homes are very similar to those in Old Bend with Craftsman and Bungalows predominating. Most homes were built in the early 20th century although you will see new construction dispersed throughout. Newport Ave., Galveston, and 14th St. are home to many restaurants, coffee shops, and retail stores, making River West a great location for those wanting to be close to it all. Some popular hangouts include 10 Barrell Brewing Company, The Victorian Cafe, Newport Market, Kanpai Sushi, Chow, and Nancy P’s Cafe & Bakery. Some of the subdivisions that lie within River West are Awbrey Heights, Bonne Home, Miller Heights, Newport Landing, West Hills, Highland Addition, and River Terrace.

The homes in this area range from small simple homes to large architecturally stunning homes. Many homes have a private feel since this is such a heavily treed area on the way to Shevlin Park. Living in this area puts you close to many of Bend’s outdoor recreation areas including Phil’s Trail, Shevlin Park, Tumalo Falls Park, and hundreds of miles of trails for mountain biking, trail running, or hiking.

		<h4>Orchard District</h4>
		<hr class="zigzag medium">
		<p class="m-t-15 text-justify">In the case of the Orchard District Neighborhood Association, a lot. When the time came for the forming neighborhood association to designate a name for themselves, the voting members felt it important not only to have a catchy name, but one that would reflect the history, boundaries, and character of the area they were to represent. It was not an easy task, considering that the areas boundaries include a state park, city park, residential neighborhoods, commercial business, and light industrial areas. The idea for Orchard District came from the historical roots of the area west of Pilot Butte. Back in the 1930's the area behind what is now Wagner Mall was an apple orchard. The orchard was an agricultural experiment for a climate challenged area such as Central Oregon. Geographically, the area , being a short distance from the river, experienced banana belt like conditions. A banana belt refers to an area that has significantly warmer conditions than the surrounding territory, thus allowing certain plants to flourish while just miles away they may not. The orchard experiment ultimately failed, but left its mark on the history of Bend. Remnants of the old orchard, including fruit trees and structures, still exist as a testament to the effort. The original orchard farm house and office are still standing and are currently in use as residences. Indeed the Orchard District Neighborhood Association by any other name would be as sweet, but will surely flourish in this banana belt. </p>

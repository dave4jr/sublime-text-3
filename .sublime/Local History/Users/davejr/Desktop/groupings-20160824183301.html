HOA: (Yes or No) If yes include below
HOA Amount: $150 
HOA Per: (month or quarter, whatever has been entered)  (on the input sheet, amount and time period are separate (month or quarter, for example). If would be ideal if we could simply show $150/month on line 6 if the answer to the HOA question on line 6 is Yes. Does that make sense? If there’s no HOA, don’t even display the lines referring to HOA.  If there is an HOA, line 6 should read the amount and time period ($400/quarter or $150/month). Not sure if we have that ability.
CC&R’s (yes or no)
Community (on the input sheet, includes pool, tennis courts, golf, etc.) Can we change the display name of that? Amenities? Just because the heading is already Community.

			<h4><strong> What Sets Us Apart? </strong></h4>
			<p class="text-justify"> With over 1,500 realitors in Central Oregon, it is one that every buyer or seller of real estate should be asking as your real estate is one of your most important financial assets and deserves the best representation. Any listing broker can look in MLS, price a home, put up a lockbox, a sign, some flyers, and hope for a buyer. Not us... BrundageSmith goes well beyond. We stake our reputation on every relationship we create. </p>
